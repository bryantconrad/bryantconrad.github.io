# Portfolio
 This is the repository for my <a href="https://bryantconrad.github.io/">portfolio site</a>. Original design and layout by me, Conrad Bryant.
 
 I used <a href="https://animate.style/">Animate.css</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox</a> and <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/">Waypoints</a>.
 
 You are free to use any of the code or design for your own use, though please include credit and a link back here if you use any significant portion.
