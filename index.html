                    <h2>DJ Interface and SportsCast</h2>

                    <p class="subheading">A couple of web apps I created to enhance the listener experience for our
                        beloved radio station.</p>
                    <p>WVUM has a robust lineup of DJs and shows, coming on at all sorts of odd and even hours. People
                        out there need to know who's spinning! Enter the aptly named:</p>
                    <h3>DJ Interface</h3>
                    <img id="wvum-dj-mockup" src="./images/dj-mockup.png" alt="dj interface">

                    <p>This interface provides a simple 2-click setup for DJs to display their show on the website.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Select / search your show name in the dropdown</li>
                        <li>Click submit, and now the world can see you</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        It's written in lightweight HTML and JavaScript, and makes use of Google Firebase for the
                        backend.
                        It's deployable anywhere and currently hosted on our website behind a password so our DJs can
                        even produce remotely.</p>
                    <p>The purpose is simple, but with our ever-rotating roster of both DJs and webmasters, it had to be
                        easy to use and maintain. And it is! See for yourself on <a href="#">Github.</a></p>

                    <h3>SportsCast</h3>
                    <img id="wvum-sports-mockup" src="./images/sportsinterface.png">
                    <p>WVUM is also the premiere destination for UM sports listening. To enhance the fan experience, we
                        wanted to show real-time game info, and we've done just that.</p>
                    <p>The needs were similar to the DJ interface: a simple UI so that minimal training is required for
                        our casters,
                        and of course the public-facing side has to be instantly readable. The execution was a bit more
                        complicated, though, because we wanted record keeping as well - not just instantaneous
                        information.</p>
                    <p>I initially created it in PHP, before coming to the numbing realization that our website CMS did
                        not support it. Cue the restart from scratch, this time using the same trusty Firebase methods
                        as our previous interface (just with a much more complex database now). And it was another
                        success! Another easily packageable/deployable, lightweight JavaScript app.</p>
                    <p>The main functionality is finished, but work is still ongoing. The roadmap has more game info
                        options
                        in the pipeline, coming soon to a <a href="#">Github</a> repo near you.</p>
                    <p class="last">I loved these projects. I got to go through the entire design and build process for
                        each, getting to work both my technical and creative muscles. You can see them in action at <a

                    <h2>GeoMuse Prototype</h2>
                    <p class="subheading">An exercise in design.</p>
                    <img src="./images/geomuse.png" alt="GeoMuse">
                    <p>This was a fun project to create a mockup of a mobile app being designed at UM. The function is
                        to aid users in exploring an area - UM's campus in this case - for art. Being only a prototype,
                        I was able to focus solely on design and UX.</p>
                    <p>I prioritized ease of navigation. The app is meant to be a complement to the larger activity of
                        sightseeing and exploring. That meant there should be no digging required to find any
                        information. Nothing in the app is more than 2 screens deep, and there is always lateral
                        movement available with no dead ends that require users to back out to switch screens. </p>
                    <p>
                        I also had consistency in mind. I sought to keep the layout similar or identical where possible
                        among different screens, so that even when performing different actions there is minimal
                        attention/learning required. I wanted to make clear where the user is at all times and to keep
                        the information layout and hierarchy as
                        simple as possible with minimal layers.</p>
